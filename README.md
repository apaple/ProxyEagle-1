# ProxyEagle
<a href="https://github.com/Z3NTL3/ProxyBeast">Use ProxyBeast instead!</a><br>
**It is a replacement by our-end for ProxyEagle.**<br>
``Proxy Beast is a extremely precisely accurate and fast proxy checker supporting HTTP, HTTPS, SOCK4, SOCKS5.``
<br><br>


 Proxy Eagle is an advanced proxy checker powered with parallelism. Using Sockets. Build with standard python libraries. The only requirement is just Python. ðŸ¦… It can also check proxy anonimity levels. It does that by only checking the ``Via``, ``X-Forwarded-For`` and ``From`` headers.

ProxyEagle is connecting to the proxies and sends a request to Google host if succeeds it saves the good proxies on 'lvl<proxyLevel>.txt' in the same directory as this tool.
