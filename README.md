# ProxyEagle
 Proxy Eagle is an advanced proxy checker powered with parallelism. Using Socket API. Build with standard python libraries. The only requirement is just Python. 🦅

ProxyEagle is connecting to the proxies and sends a request to the host ```pix4.dev:80/pix.dev:443``` if succeeds it saves the good proxies on 'goods.txt' in the same directory as this tool.
